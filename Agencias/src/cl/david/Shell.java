	Using multiple commands and conditional processing symbols

	You can run multiple commands from a single command line or script using conditional processing symbols. When you run multiple commands with conditional processing symbols, the commands to the right of the conditional processing symbol act based upon the results of the command to the left of the conditional processing symbol.

	For example, you might want to run a command only if the previous command fails. Or, you might want to run a command only if the previous command is successful. You can use the special characters listed in the following table to pass multiple commands.

	& [...]  command1 & command2
	Use to separate multiple commands on one command line. Cmd.exe runs the first command, and then the second command.

	&& [...]  command1 && command2
	Use to run the command following && only if the command preceding the symbol is successful. Cmd.exe runs the first command, and then runs the second command only if the first command completed successfully.

	|| [...]  command1 || command2
	Use to run the command following || only if the command preceding || fails. Cmd.exe runs the first command, and then runs the second command only if the first command did not complete successfully (receives an error code greater than zero).

	( ) [...]  (command1 & command2)
	Use to group or nest multiple commands.

	; or , command1 parameter1;parameter2
	Use to separate command parameters.
